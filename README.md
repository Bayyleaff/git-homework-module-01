## Notes:
1. First thing noticed was the link was broken.
    Fixed by adding "class" item for the Search Engine Optimization

    Fixed by updating box heights of the 3 items to the left until even layout is achieved.
3. Third item noticed was "Horison" wasn't the same color
    Fixed by combining and kept consistent with coloring scheme
4. Fourth item was house keeping css styles
