WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title**

## Notes:
1. First thing noticed was the link was broken.
    Fixed by adding "class" item for the Search Engine Optimization
2. Second thing noticed was that the column to the right did not sit flushed with the text boxes.
    Fixed by updating box heights of the 3 items to the left until even layout is achieved.
3. Third item noticed was "Horison" wasn't the same color
    Fixed by combining and kept consistent with coloring scheme
4. Fourth item was house keeping css styles
    Style control so that each itemized style would be directly follow the context in question. Formatted content from left to right.
